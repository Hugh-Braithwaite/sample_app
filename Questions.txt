During Lesson 3, and after we had done some re-factoring we created a test using a regular expression :-

it "should have a non-blank body" do
    get 'home'
    response.body.should_not =~ /<body>\s*<\/body>/
end

which was placed within the  describe "GET 'home'" do block

Question, whilst I cascaded this test to the other blocks, the tutorial suggest that i do not need to? because of the refactoring
I dont quite understand ??
